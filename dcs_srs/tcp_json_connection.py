"""
An SRS client starts with forming a TCP connection and trading messages with the
server in the form of single-line JSON objects. This file has an async function
for forming this TCP connection and sending and receiving those objects. Other
code can interact with this connection via two async queues. Messages added to
the send queue will be sent and any received messages will be deserialized and
added to the receive queue for some other code to pop and process. ðŸ‘Œ
